We propose a platform agnostic scheduling framework that not only enables users to design HPC applications with ease, but also performs optimized scheduling decisions that exploit both application-level and platform-level concurrency. For an application with ample scope for concurrency, we showcased the utility of leveraging simple fine-grained static scheduling algorithms over dynamic coarse-grained scheduling algorithms. Currently, the framework lacks the notion of performance models which is beneficial for taking well informed scheduling decisions. Our future endeavours include exploring different scheduling algorithms that leverage Machine Learning based predictive modelling techniques to enrich the current set of scheduling decisions available in our framework.
