title = "Exploiting Task Parallelism with OpenCL: A Case Study",
abstract = "While data parallelism aspects of OpenCL have been of primary interest due to the massively data parallel GPUs being on focus, OpenCL also provides powerful capabilities to describe task parallelism. In this article we study the task parallel concepts available in OpenCL and find out how well the different vendor-specific implementations can exploit task parallelism when the parallelism is described in various ways utilizing the command queues. We show that the vendor implementations are not yet capable of extracting kernel-level task parallelism from in-order queues automatically. To assess the potential performance benefits of in-order queue parallelization, we implemented such capabilities to an open source implementation of OpenCL. The evaluation was conducted by means of a case study of an advanced noise reduction algorithm described as a multi-kernel OpenCL application.",

abstract="To fully tap into the potential of today heterogeneous machines, offloading parts of an application on accelerators is no longer sufficient. The real challenge is to build systems where the application would permanently spread across the entire machine, that is, where parallel tasks would be dynamically scheduled over the full set of available processing units. In this paper we present SOCL, an OpenCL implementation that improves and simplifies the programming experience on heterogeneous architectures. SOCL enables applications to dynamically dispatch computation kernels over processing devices so as to maximize their utilization. OpenCL applications can incrementally make use of light extensions to automatically schedule kernels in a controlled manner on multi-device architectures. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach by experimenting with several OpenCL applications on a range of heterogeneous architectures. We show that performance portability is enhanced by using SOCL extensions.",
